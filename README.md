# Personal Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio, which showcases my projects, skills, and experience. The portfolio is deployed on AWS Amplify and can be accessed [here](https://master.d2gxklzc8grpnx.amplifyapp.com/).

## Overview

The portfolio is designed to provide a professional online presence and serves as a platform to display my work in software development and other technical domains. It includes sections for:

- **About Me**: A brief introduction and professional background.
- **Projects**: A showcase of my notable projects with descriptions and links to live demos or source code.
- **Skills**: A comprehensive list of my technical skills.
- **Contact**: A contact form to reach me directly.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes, including mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- **Interactive User Interface**: Smooth navigation with animated transitions.
- **Project Showcase**: Links to live demos and GitHub repositories.
- **Deployed on AWS Amplify**: Fast and reliable hosting with CI/CD pipeline support.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: For building the portfolio with React-based framework.
- **CSS3**: For styling and layout.
- **AWS Amplify**: For deployment and hosting.

## Deployment

The portfolio is automatically built and deployed on AWS Amplify, with continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) set up for real-time updates whenever the code is pushed to the repository.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
